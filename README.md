# 🚀 30-day GitHub challenge

Welcome to my **30-day GitHub challenge**! Over the next 30 days, I’ll be diving into advanced concepts and frameworks in web development. From deepening my understanding of JavaScript to mastering modern frontend frameworks and backend technologies, this challenge will cover both frontend and backend aspects of web development.

## 📅 Challenge Plan

### Week 1: Advanced Frontend Development
✅ **Day 1:** Advanced JavaScript: Understanding `this`, closures, and scope  
✅ **Day 2:** Mastering ES6+ Features: Destructuring, Spread/Rest, and Arrow Functions  
✅ **Day 3:** Asynchronous JavaScript: `async/await`, Promises, and error handling  
✅ **Day 4:** Deep Dive into DOM Manipulation: `createElement`, `removeChild`, and custom events  
✅ **Day 5:** CSS Grid and Flexbox: Building responsive layouts with precision  
✅ **Day 6:** Advanced CSS: Custom Properties, Variables, and Animations  
✅ **Day 7:** Introduction to CSS-in-JS and Styled Components (for React)

### Week 2: Modern JavaScript Frameworks & Libraries
🚀 **Day 8:** Introduction to React: JSX, Components, and Props  
🚀 **Day 9:** React State Management: `useState`, `useReducer`, and Context API  
🚀 **Day 10:** Component Lifecycle: `useEffect` and custom hooks in React  
🚀 **Day 11:** Routing in React with `React Router`  
🚀 **Day 12:** Introduction to Vue.js: Setting up Vue with Vuex for state management  
🚀 **Day 13:** Advanced React Patterns: Higher-Order Components (HOCs) and Render Props  
🚀 **Day 14:** Testing React Components with Jest and React Testing Library

### Week 3: Backend Development & APIs
🔥 **Day 15:** Introduction to Node.js: Setting up a server with Express.js  
🔥 **Day 16:** RESTful APIs: Designing and building a simple REST API in Express  
🔥 **Day 17:** Authentication & Authorization: JWT, OAuth, and Passport.js  
🔥 **Day 18:** Connecting Frontend to Backend: Fetching data with `axios` or `fetch`  
🔥 **Day 19:** Database Integration: SQL (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB)  
🔥 **Day 20:** Real-time Communication: WebSockets and Socket.io  
🔥 **Day 21:** GraphQL: Introduction to GraphQL and setting up a basic GraphQL API

### Week 4: Advanced Concepts & Full-Stack Development
🔗 **Day 22:** Introduction to TypeScript: Types, Interfaces, and Advanced Features  
🔗 **Day 23:** Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with React and Next.js  
🔗 **Day 24:** Building a Full-Stack App: React + Node.js + MongoDB (MERN Stack)  
🔗 **Day 25:** Advanced state management with Redux and Redux Toolkit  
🔗 **Day 26:** Microservices Architecture: Building and deploying microservices  
🔗 **Day 27:** CI/CD Pipeline: Automating deployment with GitHub Actions  
🔗 **Day 28:** Progressive Web Apps (PWA): Making your app installable and offline-first  
🏆 **Day 29:** Performance Optimization: Lazy loading, code splitting, and tree shaking  
🎉 **Day 30:** Deployment: Deploying a full-stack web app to Heroku or AWS

## 🚀 How I’m working through the challenge:
- 💻 I’ll be building projects and sharing them in this repo as I go.
- 📦 I’ll work with **modern frameworks** like React, Vue.js, and Next.js.
- 🔄 I’ll integrate **backend technologies** like Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.
- 🔧 I’ll be using **TypeScript**, **GraphQL**, and **Redux** for state management.
- 🌍 I’ll deploy my applications to cloud services like **Heroku** and **AWS**.

## 🏆 My Goals:
✅ To master **advanced JavaScript** and ES6+ features  
✅ To deepen my knowledge of **React**, **Vue**, and **Next.js**  
✅ To build real-world applications with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB/PostgreSQL**  
✅ To understand the architecture of modern **full-stack apps** (MERN, microservices)  
✅ To optimize app performance and improve **UX/UI** using **PWA** and **lazy loading**  
✅ To automate deployment with **CI/CD pipelines** using GitHub Actions
